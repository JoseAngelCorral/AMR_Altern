// BUG algorithm removed from this project.
// The autonomous IR-based bug avoidance implementation has been
// intentionally removed from the `AMR_Complete` sketch per project
// requirements. This file previously contained an experimental
// implementation and has been retained only as a marker.

// If you need to reintroduce obstacle avoidance, use a separate
// module/file and integrate carefully with existing command
// handling and odometry to avoid unexpected interactions.
